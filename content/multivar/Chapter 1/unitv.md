ok. bugga. now we talk about {{< rcol >}} SPECIAL {{</ rcol >}} types of arrows, those that lie *TANGENT* and *PERPENDICULAR* to our curve.

## Tangent vectors
First, we discuss *tangent* vectors. It's actually really simple. Just like how the derivative of a standard one variable fuction lies tangent to it, a derivative of a {{< col "orange" >}} vector {{</col>}} function lies tangent to it.

Definition 1. Tangent vector

If $\c{pink} \vec{r}(t)$ is a parameterisation of a curve $\c{lime} \mathcal{C}$ and if the derivative exists at $\c{orange} t_0$ and is non-zero, i.e. $$\Large \c{pink} \vec{r}'(t_0) \neq \vec{0}$$, then the vector $\c{pink} \vec{r}'(t_0)$ lies {{< col "pink" >}} tangent {{</col>}} to $\c{lime} \mathcal{C}$ at $\c{orange} \vec{r}(t_0)$

It goes quite similarly to the \"proof\" of the derivative of a function being tangent to it.
