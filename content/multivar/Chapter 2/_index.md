nice, made it past chapter 1! okay, now we're moving into adult territory. We defined {{<rcol>}} paths
{{</rcol>}} in the [last chapter](../chapter-1/curves), but now we're going to be looking at them in a lot more detail. 


| Section      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| {{<col "lime">}} Definitions... (You can probably skip this)  {{</col>}}   | {{<col "lime">}} just a vocab test {{</col>}}  | 
|  {{<col "orange">}} Arc length of a curve {{</col>}} | {{<col "orange">}} Just how long it is!   {{</col>}}  |
| {{<col "violet">}} Parameterise by arc length {{</col>}}   | {{<col "violet">}} Imagine defining a function $\c{pink} \vec{r}(s)$ that gives you the position of a point on a curve at a given distance along the curve! {{</col>}}  |


{{< tip >}}
and ofc in standard {{< col "tan" >}}  Micky D {{</ col >}} fashion, there will be {{< col "violet" >}}  **example problems** {{</ col >}} at the *end* of every section as well as a few {{< col "violet" >}}  **exam problems** {{</ col >}} in the *last section* of this chapter.
